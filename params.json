Destiny continues to be the primary research laboratory for U.S. payloads.\r\n- 2005\r\n- Congress designates the U.S. portion of the ISS as the nation’s newest national laboratory to maximize its use\r\n- 2011\r\n- 14th Fabruary\r\n- NASA issues a cooperative agreement notice for this management partner.\r\n- 13th July\r\n- NASA selects CASIS to manage this unique research environment.\r\n- 2008\r\n- 7th February\r\n- The European Space Agency’s Colum- bus Laboratory becomes part of the station.\r\n- 11th March\r\n- The first Japanese Kibo laboratory compartment becomes part of the station.\r\n- 2013\r\n- Proteins can be grown as crystals in space with nearly perfect three-dimensional structures useful for the development of new drugs. CASIS’ PCG series of flights will begin in 2013 and provide access for researchers to unlock the magic of space.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, thoughts were written down on how the text could be transformed into pictures, and how the pictures could make the text visually more appealing - and therefore easier and more pleasant to read. \r\nFirst sketches were made and transformed with illustrator into graphics. \r\n\r\n![](/images/astronaut_standing.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe visual choice of high contrast images in black and white was made to convey a sense of a serious scientific character without sacrificing graphic aesthetism. The black background already serves as a symbol for the universe in our common cultural reference pattern.\r\n\r\nThe title font was chosen as to be easily readable and able to capture the reader's attention.\r\nFor the running text, a good, readable Sans Serif Font was deemed the most appropriate. \r\n\r\n![](/images/fonts.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe format was chosen to support the idea of an vertical time line. The grey horizontal stripes give it a certain graphic structure, which also serves as a temporal marker.\r\n\r\n![](/images/format.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe small scale of the infographic has been chosen as to show the international importance of the ISS without overshadowing its historical aspects.\r\n\r\n![](/images/info.jpg)\r\n\r\nFinal result:\r\n\r\n![](/images/ISS14.jpg)\r\n",
