<p><em>hISStory is the visualisation of the History of the International Space Station made in the course “Input-Output” supervised by Fabian Morón Zirfas.</em></p>

<p>In the first step the information was researched and filtered to get the most important facts that happened on the ISS since it was build. </p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1984</li>
<li>25th Januar</li>
<li>President Ronald Reagan’s State of the Union address directs NASA to build an international space station within the next 10 years.</li>
<li>1998</li>
<li>20th November</li>
<li>The first segment of the ISS launches: a Russian proton rocket named Zarya (“sunrise”).</li>
<li>4th December</li>
<li>Unity, the first U.S.-built component of the International Space Station launches the first Space Shuttle mission dedicated to assembly of the station.</li>
<li>2000</li>
<li>2nd November</li>
<li>Astronaut Bill Shepherd and cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev become the first crew to reside onboard the station, staying several months.</li>
<li>2001</li>
<li>7th February</li>
<li>Destiny, the U.S. Laboratory module, becomes part of the station. Destiny continues to be the primary research laboratory for U.S. payloads.</li>
<li>2005</li>
<li>Congress designates the U.S. portion of the ISS as the nation’s newest national laboratory to maximize its use</li>
<li>2011</li>
<li>14th Fabruary</li>
<li>NASA issues a cooperative agreement notice for this management partner.</li>
<li>13th July</li>
<li>NASA selects CASIS to manage this unique research environment.</li>
<li>2008</li>
<li>7th February</li>
<li>The European Space Agency’s Colum- bus Laboratory becomes part of the station.</li>
<li>11th March</li>
<li>The first Japanese Kibo laboratory compartment becomes part of the station.</li>
<li>2013</li>
<li>Proteins can be grown as crystals in space with nearly perfect three-dimensional structures useful for the development of new drugs. CASIS’ PCG series of flights will begin in 2013 and provide access for researchers to unlock the magic of space.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, thoughts were written down on how the text could be transformed into pictures, and how the pictures could make the text visually more appealing - and therefore easier and more pleasant to read. 
First sketches were made and transformed with illustrator into graphics. </p>

<p>The visual choice of high contrast images in black and white was made to convey a sense of a serious scientific character without sacrificing graphic aesthetism. The black background already serves as a symbol for the universe in our common cultural reference pattern.</p>

<p>The title font was chosen as to be easily readable and able to capture the reader's attention.
For the running text, a good, readable Sans Serif Font was deemed the most appropriate. </p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/swjo/hisstory-/raw/master/images/fonts.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The format was chosen to support the idea of an vertical time line. The grey horizontal stripes give it a certain graphic structure, which also serves as a temporal marker.</p>

<p>The small scale of the infographic has been chosen as to show the international importance of the ISS without overshadowing its historical aspects.</p>
